fedora-info

A tool for reporting information about a Fedora system that is
useful when asking for help to solve an issue.

Fedora-info is inspired by the wonderful inxi tool that is the
goto tool for providing information on https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/

The issue with inxi is that installing it pulls in a lots of
dependencies. The goal of fedora-info is to have a tool that
is a single python script with no extra dependences required
that could be installed on Fedora as standard, like fpaste is.
